## About This Repository

This repository is to store various labs & assignments demoing the use of various data structures. Through this course i learned about how to implement and use things such as hashsets, linked lists, bninary trees, graphs, stacks, & queues.

## Projects

### Labs

- **Lab Loops and Conditionals:** Practice assignemnt to demo using various loops and conditonals.

- **Lab Collections:** An in-class lab where we went over the basics of using a stack.

- **Lab Stacks:** An in-class lab where we went over the basics of using a stack.

- **Lab Queues:** An in-class lab where we went over the basics of using a queue.

- **Lab Hashsets:** An in-class lab where we went over the basics of using a hashset.

- **Lab Trees:** An in-class lab where we went over the basics of using a tree.


### Assignments

- **Assignment DS Foundations:** An assignemnt to go through and predict Big O Notation for various data structures.

- **Assignment Linked Lists:** An assignment going over creating, using, and altering linked lists in C#.

- **Assignment Stacks:** An assignment going over creating, using, and altering Stacks in C#.

- **Assignment Queues:** An assignment going over creating, using, and altering queues in C#.

- **Assignment Hashsets:** An assignment going over creating, using, and altering hashsets in C#.

- **Assignment Trees:** An assignment going over creating, using, and altering binary trees in C#.

- **Assignment Graphs:** An assignment going over creating, using, and altering graphs in C#.


### Final Project

**RPG Skill Tree Planner**

A skill tree from an RPG game where you can plan character builds. For example to get the fireball skill you need 5 points in magic and the spark skill. This project uses a tree / graph to model skill dependancies, a dictionary to lookup a kill by name in O(1) time, and a stack for an undo feature when allocating points.

## How to Run

Each project contains its own README with specific build and run instructions.

**General steps:**

```bash

cd [project-directory]

dotnet build

dotnet run

```

Most of these can also be built and ran in visual studio.
